# Project Three
Full Stack App with the MERN Stack
## Pie Shop

### The Goal: 
Make a site that almost operates like a store. We're selling pies here, so we have a users section for the users to create an account and a pies section where the users, signed in or not, can see all the pies on sale. They can read their descriptions and see their price and even write a review. 
One of my favorite little attributes to the site is on the individual pie page -- it had a toggle that when clicked will reveal a review form. After completing a title and description, the review will pop up on the screen right under the pie. Once the user hits hide, then the form will hide again.

#### For the Future - Version Two:
1. Fixing the nav-bar and adding a footer
I want to have some dynamic action like hover all through react.
2. Clean up style-components and dry up the code
So many buttons! Many of which all have the same styling, so breaking the repeated code into a component is on the list. 
3. Hide the word "Reviews" until the user hits "hide/show review form"
4. Hide and show the Signup form upon the user asking for it. 
5. Have the users add "custom" pies to their cart.
